Visual Pinball is a freeware and source available video game engine for pinball tables and similar games such as pachinko machines. 

The software is composed of an editor and the simulator part itself. It runs on Microsoft Windows. 

The program is also able to operate with Visual PinMAME, an emulator for ROM images from real pinball [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Pinball)
